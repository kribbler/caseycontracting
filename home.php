	<h2>ABOUT CASEY CONTRACTING:</h2>
	<p>After completing high school, and setting my sights to become a pilot, I spent the summer of 1978 
	working for a local carpenter.  Not only was this occupation fulfilling, it was giving me a sense of 
	accomplishment at the end of each and every day.  It wasn't long before I realized there might be a need 
	to re-consider my career...
	</p>
	<p>I knew I wanted to work in Muskoka and started a construction company. Casey Contracting was formed.
	</p>
	<p>Thirty Years later I am still swinging a hammer, and enjoying the continued fulfillment of working in 
	one of Ontario's treasured regions.
	</p>
	<p>I am very fortunate to be making a living in Muskoka, and continue to be excited about every project 
	taking place.  The rewards are endless and they all result from a number of criteria, the most important 
	being... the people we work for.  Without our clients, and potential clients.......where would we be?
	With all the good fortune of a healthy working atmosphere, working with my hands, a career in Cottage 	
	Country, and doing what I love to do, there is no way I would jeopardize my situation.
	</p>
	<p>Thirty  years, and more to come.</p>
	<p>That is the basis of a company you can trust.</p>

	<p><strong>Build in Muskoka. Get Hooked on the Feeling</strong></p>
